## District Summary **
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:
Total number of unique schools
Total students
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)



## School Summary**
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

Include the following:
School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

**Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)**
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

**Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)**
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

## Math Scores by Grade**
Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Reading Scores by Grade**
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Scores by School Spending**
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
create a DataFrame called spending_summary.

Include the following metrics in the table:
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## Scores by School Size**
Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

## Scores by School Type**
Use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.
This new DataFrame should show school performance based on the "School Type".
